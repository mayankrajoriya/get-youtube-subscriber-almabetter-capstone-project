# Get Youtube Subscribers

ðŸ‘‹ Hey There,
this repository houses my code for the Get Youtube Subscribers API. This app was made as part of my Almabetter course, for my Backend Capstone Project.

This API project has 3 endpoints /subscribers, /subscribers/names and /subscribers/:id. Here the response is in JSON format and being a Backend Project there is no Frontend to this and was not a part of the acceptance criteria as well. The code here is entirely javascript.
